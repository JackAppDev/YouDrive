# YouDrive

## An online file manager

#### Installation
1. Open terminal
2. cd to path
3. ```npm install```

#### Usage
1. Open terminal
2. cd to path
3. ```node app.js```
4. open browser
5. go to localhost:3000

#### Why
My idea is to allow anyone to host this themselves and then they will have their own google drive for personal use. 

#### Benifits
- Access your files anywhere
- Expand your storage anytime
- Customize it anyway

#### How to help
1. Pick something from "goals" in the projects tab
2. do it
